    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    I am fortunate enough to know the utter delight of figuring out why programs make the
choices they do, and have discovered how to test them to make sure the quality is high. I
have seen many areas that could benefit from well-written software, and want to be a
part of making sure that it exists, and can be used by those of any age. I am gaining and
applying some of these skills in projects and becoming confident in testing. I am looking
to use this in a permanent position, for the betterment of people.

        <h2>Work History</h2>
    I was self-employed with my father as The Wood Shop, and then continued under Rings and Reads after his death.
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintaining a database of both customers and inventory</li>
        <li>Production of wooden and knitted items</li>
        <li>Planning layout and design</li>
        <li>Accurate time estimation for finished items</li>
        <li>Storage and shipping of items and supplies</li>
        <li>Record keeping for tax and budgeting</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    Previous to this, we had a small employment agency, doing both local business and US-wide agricultural placements. 
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintaining records of clients, including confidentiality</li>
        <li>Contacting businesses with new clients of potential interest</li>
        <li>Maintaining records for legal purposes</li>
        <li>Contract enforcement</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    These two businesses we supplemented during slow points, but I was able to maintain contributing to them.
