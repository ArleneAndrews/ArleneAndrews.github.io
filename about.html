    I was self-employed with my father as The Wood Shop, and then continued under Rings and Reads after his death.
    <p></p>
    - Maintaining a database of both customers and inventory
    - Production of wooden and knitted items
    - Planning layout and design
    - Accurate time estimation for finished items
    - Storage and shipping of items and supplies
    - Record keeping for tax and internal income
    <p></p>
    Previous to this, we had a small employment agency, doing both local business and US-wide agricultural placements. 
    <p></p>
    - Maintaining records of clients, including confidentiality
    - Contacting businesses with new clients of potential interest
    - Maintaining records for legal purposes

    These two businesses we supplemented during slow points, but I was able to maintain contributing to them.
