    <div id = "history">
    I was self-employed with my father as The Wood Shop, and then continued under Rings and Reads after his death.
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintaining a database of both customers and inventory</li>
        <li>Production of wooden and knitted items</li>
        <li>Planning layout and design</li>
        <li>Accurate time estimation for finished items</li>
        <li>Storage and shipping of items and supplies</li>
        <li>Record keeping for tax and budgeting</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    Previous to this, we had a small employment agency, doing both local business and US-wide agricultural placements. 
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintaining records of clients, including confidentiality</li>
        <li>Contacting businesses with new clients of potential interest</li>
        <li>Maintaining records for legal purposes</li>
        <li>Contract enforcement</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    These two businesses we supplemented during slow points, but I was able to maintain contributing to them.
