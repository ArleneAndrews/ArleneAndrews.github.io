          <h2>Previous Work History</h2>

          I was self-employed with my father as The Wood Shop, and then
          continued under the name Rings and Reads after his death.
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintaining a database of both customers and inventory</li>
            <li>Production of wooden and knitted items</li>
            <li>Planning layout and design</li>
            <li>Accurate time estimation for finished items</li>
            <li>Storage and shipping of items and supplies</li>
            <li>Record keeping for tax and budgeting</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          Previous to this, we had a small employment agency, doing both local
          business and US-wide agricultural placements.
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintaining records of clients, including confidentiality</li>
            <li>
              Contacting businesses with new clients of potential interest
            </li>
            <li>Maintaining records for legal purposes</li>
            <li>Contract enforcement</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          These two businesses we supplemented during slow points, but I was
          able to maintain contributing to them.
          <p></p>
